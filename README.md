## The tool to access GTFOBins' list of binaries on the go!

This tool is intended for use in testing systems when there is no access to a GUI / X11, or even just a browser.
>Please note: This tool is self-updating and as a result uses HTTP requests to access the GTFObins data. Therefore, an internet connection is required.

## Usage

1. Install the required dependencies:
`pip3 install -r requirements`

2. Run the tool:
`python3 GTFOBuddy.py`

3. Search for binaries!
